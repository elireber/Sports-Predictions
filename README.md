# Sports-Predictions

This project was an investigation as to how accurate the Pythagorean Expectation is able to predict the winning percentage of the next season.  The main hyperparameter in the expectation is a value K (see explanation of K here - https://www.pinnacle.com/en/betting-articles/Betting-Strategy/using-pythagorean-expectation-for-betting/8LX2CRDC6JVXWDAC).  Different sports have different optimal values of K, and those values, as well as the expectation's overall predictiive ability, are explored in this project.
